- 👋 Hi, I’m @kunarex
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, microbiome, dogs and training dogs (because mine are naughty), woodworking, tennis, golf, fig trees (because fresh figs are delicious).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Python and bash (is that what it's called?) scripts. I'm almost done with a masters in Bioinformatics from Juniata college. It's so much fun!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ... will be looking for a job soon!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
