- 👋 Hi, I’m @kunarex
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, microbiome, dogs and training dogs (because mine are naughty), woodworking, tennis, golf, fig trees (because fresh figs are delicious).
- 🌱 I can program in R and Python and bash, and completed a masters in Bioinformatics from Juniata College in December 2023. It's so much fun!!
- 💞️ I work at Wright Labs as a bioinformatics scientist
- 📫 I live in San Diego CA
